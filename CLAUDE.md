# CLAUDE.md — Pressmark

An editorial, paper-bound design system. Two published npm packages plus an Astro demo deployed to GitHub Pages.

## What this is

| | |
|---|---|
| Repo | https://github.com/tomasz-tomczyk/pressmark |
| Demo | https://tomasz-tomczyk.github.io/pressmark/ |
| `@pressmark/theme` | Tailwind v4 CSS-only theme — single file, drop-in, no JS |
| `@pressmark/astro` | Astro v5 components & layouts that render the theme classes |

Originally called "Vellum" — the user may still refer to it that way colloquially. The published name is "Pressmark" because npm reserved `@vellum` and several other editorial nouns (see `~/.claude/projects/-Users-tomasztomczyk-Server-side/memory/project_pressmark_naming.md`).

## Commands

```sh
bun install                # install all workspace deps
bun run dev                # demo at http://localhost:4321
bun run build              # static build into apps/demo/dist/

# Publishing (manual, until Trusted Publishing is set up on npmjs.com)
npm publish --workspace=@pressmark/theme --otp=XXXXXX
npm publish --workspace=@pressmark/astro --otp=XXXXXX
```

The root scripts use `bun --filter=demo run <script>` — note the explicit `run`; without it, bun interprets `build`/`dev` as its own bundler subcommand.

## Design constraints — NON-NEGOTIABLE

These are user-enforced rules. Re-deriving them ourselves doesn't fly.

### Palette — exactly six colors, no others

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `paper` | `#F6F4EE` | main background |
| `warm-white` | `#ECE9E2` | soft surfaces, badges, soft borders |
| `stone` | `#D9D6CC` | dividers, soft surfaces |
| `warm-gray` | `#ABA49A` | TINY MONO CAPTIONS ONLY |
| `charcoal` | `#1F1F1F` | primary text, dark surfaces |
| `accent` | `#E05A24` | the one accent |

- Never introduce a 7th hex. Compose from the six.
- For a "muted text" effect, don't add a new gray — use font-size/weight to drop hierarchy.
- For a "soft accent" background, use `bg-accent/15` or `/25`, not a new color.

### Text rules
- **All text is `charcoal`** except links/CTAs in `accent`.
- `warm-gray` is **reserved for the smallest mono captions** (`panel-label`, dataset codes). Don't use it for body copy or muted text — that's a Skill DON'T trap.

### Fonts — three only
- **Crimson Pro** (display, variable, 300–700)
- **Inter** (sans, 400/500/600/700)
- **IBM Plex Mono** (mono, 400/500/600)

The Google Fonts URL is baked into `BaseLayout.astro` head.

### Other rules
- **No gradients.** Anywhere. Not in placeholders, not in buttons, not in backgrounds. The constraint forces hierarchy through typography and space.
- **Image placeholders**: `https://picsum.photos/seed/{name}/{w}/{h}` with stable seeds. NEVER `source.unsplash.com` (deprecated). NEVER gradient `<div>`s.
- **No arbitrary Tailwind sizes** like `text-[13px]`. Use the built-in scale (`text-xs/sm/base/lg/...`). Inline code is `0.8em`, baked into the theme.
- **Badges/tags/pills**: `warm-white` bg, `charcoal` text, **no border**. Pre-built `.badge` / `.badge-mono` utilities — use them, don't repeat the class string.
- **Page layout**: 260px fixed left sidebar at `top-12 bottom-0`, right border `warm-white`. Main is `<main class="ml-[260px] px-12 py-10">`. Post page adds `xl:mr-[300px]` for the right rail. All pages full-width, left-anchored — no `mx-auto` centered max-width.

### CSS classes published as API
- `.btn` / `.btn-primary` / `.btn-secondary` / `.btn-link`
- `.badge` / `.badge-mono`
- `.card`, `.hairline`, `.nav-item`, `.panel-label`, `.section-label`
- `.checkbox`, `.progress` + `.progress-fill`
- `.prose-pressmark` + `.dropcap`

Renaming these is a breaking change — bump the major version.

## Anti-goals (deliberate omissions)

- **WCAG 2.1 AA contrast** is NOT a target. warm-gray on paper is 2.24:1, accent on paper is 3.37:1, warm-white borders are 1.10:1. We tested a high-contrast AA variant; user rejected it as aesthetically wrong for the brand. Consumers shipping on public sites are warned in the README.
- **Dark mode** is not implemented.
- **JS interactivity** is not yet wired (theme toggle, search modal, etc. are static).

## Known follow-ups

- `Sidebar.astro` has demo-specific nav items hardcoded (Notes/Journal/Projects/etc.). Should accept `items` as a prop so consumers can use it generically. Tracked in the rebrand commit message.
- `PostLayout` exists but the demo's `post.astro` uses `BaseLayout` + inline right rail instead — bespoke right-rail content didn't fit `PostLayout`'s prop API.
- Trusted Publishing setup on npmjs.com (per-package) not yet done; publishes still require OTP.

## Tooling notes

- This is a **bun workspaces** monorepo. Don't suggest pnpm migration unless asked.
- The user has `ast-grep`, `difftastic`, `sd`, `comby`, `hyperfine`, `git-delta`, `scc`, `yq` globally — prefer these where they fit (e.g., `sd` for batch text replacements).
- See `~/Server/side/CLAUDE.md` for context-mode routing rules that apply to all projects in `Server/side/`.
